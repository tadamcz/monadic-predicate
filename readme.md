# Monadic predicate logic theoremhood checker
* Monadic predicate logic (with identity) is decidable (LÃ¶wenheim-Skolem 1915, or more conveniently Boolos, Burgess, and Jeffrey 2007, Ch. 21). This tool lets you can check whether a formula is a theorem. If it's not a theorem, you will be shown a counter-example.
* You can [run it in your browser](https://monadic-predicate.herokuapp.com/).
